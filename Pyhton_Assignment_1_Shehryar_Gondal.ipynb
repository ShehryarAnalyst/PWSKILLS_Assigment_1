    "\n",
    "__Ans__)In Python,__memory management__ is automatically handled by the __interpreter's garbage collector__ and __reference counting mechanism__. The garbage collector frees up memory no longer in use, while the reference counting mechanism tracks the number of references to an object. This eliminates the need for manual memory management and helps to ensure efficient and error-free code."
